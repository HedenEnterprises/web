> Kubernetes deployment with static content built from html templates.

In less simple terms, this project generates static html files from html/php
files along with a basic templating system. It then builds those static html
files into a Docker image and deploys it to a Kubernetes cluster.

You're free to use this repository to do the same thing if you so desire.
